# Julia-Fractal
Generate beautiful Julia Set Fractals from Newton Raphson Method


-> How do we create fractals?

Fractals can be derived from the Newton-Raphson method, which is more normally used as an approximate method of solving equations.

When we apply Newtonâ€™s method to complex functions, interesting results appear.

Sample Fractal generated using this code:
